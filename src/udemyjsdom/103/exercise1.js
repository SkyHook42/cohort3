//Evaluate the below:
5 + "34" //guess: 39, actual: "534" - thought the string had to be first to coerce
5 - "4" //guess: 1, actual: 1
10 % 5 //guess: 0, actual: 0
5 % 10 //guess: 5, actual: 5
"Java" + "Script" //guess: JavaScript, actual: JavaScript
" " + " " //guess: "  ", actual: "  "
" " + 0 //guess: " 0", actual: " 0"
true + true //guess: true, actual: 2 - ah!
true + false //guess: 1, actual: 1
false + true //guess: 1, actual: 1
false - true //guess: -1, actual: -1
3 - 4 //guess: -1, actual: -1
"Bob" - "bill" //guess: Nan, actual: Nan

//Evaluate the below comparisons:
5 >= 1 //guess: true, actual: true
0 === 1 //guess: false, actual: false
4 <= 1 //guess: false, actual: false
1 != 1 //guess: false, actual: false
"A" > "B" //guess: true, actual: false - ? I thought caps came in order?
"B" < "C" //guess: false, actual: true - rule holds, uphill not downhill
"a" > "A" //guess: false, actual: true - so lc before uc too
//okay, I looked it up, basic ASCII but I had it inverted
"b" < "A" //guess: false, actual: false
true === false //guess: false, actual: false
true != true //guess: false, actual: false

// Make the string: "Hi There! It's "sunny" out" by using the + sign:
str = '"Hi There! It\'s '+'"sunny" out"';
// probably better to use all breakouts to avoid quote chaos
