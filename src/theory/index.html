        Can you emulate AND statement using only NOT and OR statements? Imagine
        that you have only NOT (negation) and OR (disjunction) at your disposal.
        You have propositions p1 and p2, and you need to emulate their
        conjunction (p1 AND p2) using only negation and disjunction. How can you
        do that?
        <ul>
          <li>P1 && P2 = !(!P1||!P2)</li>

This is a sly reference to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ladyhawke</a> (1985) which was also directed by Richard Donner and produced by his then future-wife, Lauren Shuler.

      You know what that hawk means?
      Nothing, but you didn't know that.

      You didn't.</pre>
